## Understanding Results

### PITI Breakdown

PITI stands for Principal, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance:

- **Principal**: The portion of your payment that reduces the loan balance
- **Interest**: The cost of borrowing money
- **Taxes**: Property taxes paid to local government
- **Insurance**: Homeowners insurance and possibly PMI

### Key Metrics

#### Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
Calculate your DTI by dividing your total monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income. Most lenders prefer DTI below 43%.

#### Price per Square Foot
Divide the purchase price by the square footage to compare properties.

#### Monthly Payment Affordability
A general rule: your housing payment should not exceed 28% of your gross monthly income.
